<!--Welcome to "I am...a project in becoming!" Read through these code comments for instructions on how to design a website where audiences can learn about who you are and where you're going. Along the way, you'll learn everything you need to know to get started working with code.-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language. In this case, United States English. Search engines, browsers, and screen readers use this information to deliver content specific to user needs.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">

<head>
<!--The <head> element contains additional information for search engines and browsers.--> 
<!--The <title> tag controls the name on the browser tab.-->
  <title>I am here...</title>
<!--This website follows the Unicode 8-bit character set that standardizes all of the letters from all of the languages in the world--emojis too!-->
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
<!--This viewport <meta> tag standard tells browsers how to display the website across different sized screens.-->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--This <link> (rel)ates to the cascading style sheet or CSS in your project folder. Web designers use CSS to add styling to a website. Using CSS saves time and results in fewer lines of code.-->
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>

<!--The <body> element organizes all of the code and content that actually appears on a screen. You can change the background color by opening the style.css document in the body tag properties. Choose a color with enough contrast for your audience. Neutral colors work best for the greatest number of viewers.-->
<body>

<!--Developers refer to this next section as the "hero image." 
Fill in the blank between <h1>"I am..."</h1> and see what happens.
To replace this image, simply find and delete the hero.jpg file in the project folder. Then add a new .jpg hero image to the project folder and name it hero.jpg. Select an image at least 1200px in width to avoid pixilation. If an image is larger than 1200px, you will want to resize it speed up load time. Crop image height to ensure desired fit.--> 

<!--The "hero-image" properties are controlled on the style.css document. We know this because the <div> calls the class="hero-image". You can open the style.css file and find the hero-image class to edit its properties. Alternatively you can edit the file height by cropping the image to fit within the hero-image.-->

<!--Privacy is important factor to consider in online composing. How much do you want others to know about you and what images do you want circulating on the internet? Choose your images and other content carefully and be thoughtful about how your content could impact others. If you are concerned about issues of privacy, you can always use stock images, or get creative in other ways.-->

The style.css page provides other attributes that will adjust the image depending on the size of screens. Add images to your project folder and make sure the file name/type matches in your code.
